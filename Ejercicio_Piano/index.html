                    The Rhodes piano is an electro-mechanical piano, invented by Harold Rhodes during the fifties and
                    later manufactured in a number of models, first in collaboration with Fender and after 1965 by CBS.
                    It employs a piano-like keyboard with hammers that hit small metal tines, amplified by
                    electromagnetic pickups.

                    The Wurlitzer electric piano is an electro-mechanical piano, created by the Rudolph Wurlitzer
                    Company of Mississippi. The Wurlitzer company itself never called the instrument an "electric
                    piano", instead inventing the phrase "Electronic Piano" and using this as a trademark throughout
                    the production of the instrument. It employs a piano-like keyboard with hammers that hit small
                    metal tines, amplified by electromagnetic pickups.

                    A Clavinet is an electronically amplified clavichord manufactured by the Hohner company. Each key
                    uses a rubber tip to perform a hammer on a string. Its distinctive bright staccato sound is often
                    compared to that of an electric guitar. Various models were produced over the years, including the
                    models I, II, L, C, D6, and E7.
